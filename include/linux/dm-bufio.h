/*
 * dm_bufio_client_create --- create a buffered IO cache on a given device
 * dm_bufio_client_destroy --- release a buffered IO cache
 *
 * dm_bufio_read --- read a given block from disk. Returns pointer to data.
 *	Returns a pointer to dm_buffer that can be used to release the buffer
 *	or to make it dirty.
 * dm_bufio_get --- like dm_bufio_read, but return buffer from cache, don't read
 *	it. If the buffer is not in the cache, return NULL.
 * dm_bufio_new --- like dm_bufio_read, but don't read anything from the disk.
 *	It is expected that the caller initializes the buffer and marks it
 *	dirty.
 * dm_bufio_release --- release a reference obtained with dm_bufio_read or
 *	dm_bufio_new. The data pointer and dm_buffer pointer is no longer valid
 *	after this call.
 *
 * WARNING: to avoid deadlocks, this conditions are required:
 *	At most one thread can hold at most "reserved_buffers" simultaneously
 *	Each other threads can hold at most one buffer
 *	Threads which call only dm_bufio_get can hold unlimited number of
 *	buffers
 *
 * dm_bufio_mark_buffer_dirty --- mark a buffer dirty. It should be called after
 *	the buffer is modified.
 * dm_bufio_write_dirty_buffers --- write all dirty buffers. Guarantees that all
 *	dirty buffers created prior to this call are on disk when this call
 *	exits.
 * dm_bufio_issue_flush --- send an empty write barrier to the device to flush
 *	hardware disk cache.
 *
 * In case of memory pressure, the buffer may be written after
 *	dm_bufio_mark_buffer_dirty, but before dm_bufio_write_dirty_buffers.
 *	So dm_bufio_write_dirty_buffers guarantees that the buffer is on-disk
 *	but the actual writing may occur earlier.
 *
 * dm_bufio_release_move --- like dm_bufio_release but also move the buffer to
 *	the new block. dm_bufio_write_dirty_buffers is needed to commit the new
 *	block.
 * dm_bufio_drop_buffers --- clear all buffers.
