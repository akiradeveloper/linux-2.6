  - [X] CRC bitmaps 						        :ejt:

  - [X] Test creation/removal of large numbers of devices	       :mike:
  - [X] wire up btree value_types					:ejt:
  - [X] printks						       :mike:

  - [ ] Check reference counts are correct somehow.			:ejt:
  - [ ] some work needs to be done to verify tearing down thin devices
        when the pool has run out of space is done cleanly              :ejt:

** Userland tools [0/5]

All tools run offline for first release.

  - [ ] multisnap_format						:ejt:
  - [ ] multisnap_repair						:ejt:
  - [ ] multisnap_calc_metadata_size					:ejt:
  - [ ] multisnap_display						:ejt:
  - [ ] multisnap lib							:ejt:
        C library to wrap multisnap tools

* Subsequent release

** Kernel

  - [ ] factor common code in space map
  - [ ] resize metadata device
  - [ ] implement the btree trimming
  - [ ] external origin (read-only)
  - [ ] Discard
  - [ ] a bug found in the userland tools, check that nr_free in the
    last index entry is being set correctly if there are fewer than a
    whole blocks worth.  Also check this is extended correctly.
  - [ ] RHEL6.2 needs kzalloc

** Userland tools

  - [ ] multisnap_display
        That uses the held_root to do this for an online pool

** Test suite

  - [ ] We need tests with multiple pools
  - [ ] Integrate Kabi's ramdisk tests, and use the pattern stomp
    program he's found (http://www.scsifaq.org/RMiller_Tools/dt.html).
